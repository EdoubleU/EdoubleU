- 👋 Hi, I’m Ethan!
- 👀 I’m interested in ... basketball, creating and playing games of both a digital and physical nature, and general software/web development.
- 🌱 I’m transitioning from programming as a hobby/ancillary work function to software development as a full-time profession.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on almost anything JS-related, but I am extra excited about anything basketball-related.

- 😄 Pronouns: Him/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I've spent 20 years building sports/programs in physical spaces and it's pretty amazing how similar developing them in the digital realm feels.
