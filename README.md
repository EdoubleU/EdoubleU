- 👋 Hi, I’m Ethan!
- 👀 I’m interested in ... Basketball, Creating and playing games of both a digital and physical nature and software/web development.
- 🌱 I’m transitioning from a couple of years of programming as a hobby/ancillary work function to software development as a full-time profession.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on almost anything, but I am extra excited for anything basketball-related.
