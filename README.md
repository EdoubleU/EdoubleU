<li> 👋 Hi, I’m Ethan!</li>
<li> 👀 I’m interested in ... basketball, creating and playing games of both a digital and physical nature, and general software/web development. </li>
<li> 🌱 I’m transitioning from programming as a hobby/ancillary work function to software development as a full-time profession. </li>
<li> 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on almost anything JS-related, but I am extra excited about anything basketball-related. </li>
<li> 📫 How to reach me: <a href="http://ethanwing20@gmail.com">ethanwing20@gmail.com</a></li>
<li> 😄 Pronouns: Him/Him </li>
<li> ⚡ Fun fact: I've spent 20 years building sports/programs in physical spaces and it's pretty amazing how similar developing them in the digital realm feels. </li>
